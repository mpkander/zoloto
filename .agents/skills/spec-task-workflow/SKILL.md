description: Execute tasks from the plan sequentially, validate each task, and report progress at checkpoints.
---

## Overview

This repository uses spec-driven development. Features are implemented by following
pre-approved plans derived from specifications.

**Your role:** Execute tasks from the plan sequentially, validate each task, and
report progress at checkpoints.

---

## Directory Structure
```
/spec/**/                      # READ-ONLY — Do not modify during implementation
  requirements.md           # Business requirements and clarifications
  acceptance-criteria.md    # Behavioral specs (WHEN-THEN-SHALL)
  architecture.md            # Architecture, constraints, patterns
  plan.yaml                 # Execution plan (phased plan with dependencies)
  status.md                 # Progress tracking (you update this)
```

## Task List Workflow

### Initialization

When starting work on a feature:
```
1. READ spec/architecture.md
   → Understand architecture and constraints

2. READ spec/acceptance-criteria.md
   → Understand expected behavior

3. READ spec/plan.yaml
   → Understand phases, dependencies, checkpoints

4. READ spec/status.md
   → Determine current position in plan
   → If file doesn't exist, create it with phase-1, task-1.1 as NOT_STARTED

5. SET current_task = first task with status NOT_STARTED
```

### Main Execution Loop
```
WHILE current_task EXISTS:

    1. LOAD task card from spec/plan.yaml
    
    2. CHECK prerequisites
       FOR each task_id in task.depends_on:
           IF status[task_id] != COMPLETE:
               HALT with error "Dependency {task_id} not complete"
    
    3. UPDATE status.md
       SET current_task.status = IN_PROGRESS
    
    4. EXECUTE task
       - Follow instructions in task card
       - Create/modify only files listed in task card
       - Apply constraints from constraints.md
    
    5. VALIDATE task
       FOR each criterion in task.acceptance:
           RUN validation check
           IF check FAILS:
               INCREMENT retry_count
               IF retry_count > 2:
                   SET current_task.status = BLOCKED
                   HALT with VALIDATION_FAILURE report
               ELSE:
                   GOTO step 4 (retry execution)
    
    6. COMPLETE task
       UPDATE status.md:
           SET current_task.status = COMPLETE
           ADD to completed_tasks table
    
    7. DETERMINE next action
       IF current_task is last task in phase:
           HALT with CHECKPOINT report
           WAIT for approval
           IF approved:
               SET current_task = first task of next phase
           ELSE IF revision requested:
               PROCESS revision instructions
               CONTINUE
       ELSE:
           SET current_task = next task in phase (task-{phase}.{n+1})

END WHILE

GENERATE completion report
```

### Phase Transitions
```
WHEN last task of phase completes:

    1. COLLECT phase summary
       - List all completed tasks
       - List all created files
       - Map to acceptance criteria from spec

    2. GENERATE checkpoint report (see format below)

    3. HALT execution

    4. WAIT for human response:
       
       IF "APPROVED":
           CONTINUE to next phase
       
       IF "APPROVED WITH NOTES: {notes}":
           RECORD notes in status.md
           CONTINUE to next phase
       
       IF "REVISE: task-{phase}.{n} - {instructions}":
           SET current_task = specified task
           SET current_task.status = IN_PROGRESS
           APPLY revision instructions
           RE-VALIDATE task
           RESUME from step 7 of main loop
       
       IF "BLOCKED: {reason}":
           RECORD blocker in status.md
           HALT until blocker resolved
```

## Status File Format

Maintain `spec/**/status.md`:
```markdown
# Implementation Status: {feature}

## Current Position
- Phase: {phase-id}
- Task: task-{phase}.{n}
- Status: NOT_STARTED | IN_PROGRESS | BLOCKED | COMPLETE

## Progress

### Phase 1: {phase name}
| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| task-1.1 | ✓ COMPLETE | |
| task-1.2 | ✓ COMPLETE | |
| task-1.3 | → IN_PROGRESS | |
| task-1.4 | · NOT_STARTED | |

### Phase 2: {phase name}
| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| task-2.1 | · NOT_STARTED | |
| task-2.2 | · NOT_STARTED | |

## Checkpoints
| Phase | Status | Approved |
|-------|--------|----------|
| phase-1 | PENDING | |
| phase-2 | NOT_REACHED | |

## Blockers
<!-- empty if none -->

## Deviations
<!-- record any approved deviations from plan -->
```

IMPORTANT: Add notes to the tasks upon completion.

## Checkpoint Report Format
```markdown
# Checkpoint: Phase {n} Complete

- Phase: {phase-id} — {phase name}
- Tasks completed: {n}/{n}

---

## Rules

### MUST
- Process tasks in order within each phase
- Verify all prerequisites before starting a task
- Validate all acceptance criteria before marking complete
- Update status.md after each task state change
- Stop at every checkpoint and wait for approval
- Stop immediately when blocked

### MUST NOT
- Modify files in `/spec/` directory
- Skip tasks or reorder tasks within a phase
- Proceed past checkpoint without explicit approval
- Proceed when blocked without resolution
- Create files not specified in the current task card
- Modify files outside current task's scope

### SHOULD
- Reference constraint IDs when applying rules from constraints.md
- Record reasoning for non-obvious implementation decisions
- Note potential improvements discovered during implementation

## Quick Reference

|-------|--------|
| Starting feature | Initialize → Read specs → Read plan → Find current task |
| Starting task | Load card → Check prerequisites → Update status → Execute |
| Task complete | Validate → Update status → Check if phase end |
| Phase complete | Generate checkpoint report → HALT → Wait for approval |
| Blocked | Generate blocker report → HALT → Wait for resolution |
| All phases complete | Generate completion report |
